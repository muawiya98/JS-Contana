Directory Structure:

1. Codes:
   This folder contains all the code files for working on the payload files. It includes the scripts and modules necessary for processing and analyzing the payload data.

2. Feature_selection_results:
   This folder contains the results of executing code for dynamic feature selection based on reinforcement learning. It includes information about the selected features and their importance in the context of the project.

3. Hiden:
   This folder contains the hidden states resulting from combining the hidden states of the two BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) layers with dynamic word embedding. The hidden states are intermediate representations learned during the model training process.

4. Results:
   This folder contains the results of training the JSContana model. It includes evaluation metrics, model performance, and any other relevant information regarding the trained model. Additionally, it also includes visual representations (e.g., pictures) depicting the results obtained from the project.

5. Results_TabuSearch:
   This folder contains the results of the tabu search algorithm. It includes the output and findings obtained from applying the tabu search algorithm, which is a metaheuristic algorithm used for optimization problems.

6. Results_for_Entre_Static_Word_Embedding:
   This folder contains the results of data entry on a JSContana form without using the two BiLSTM layers. The data entry process was performed using a static word embedding approach. The folder includes the results and analysis based on this approach.

7. DataSets:
   This folder contains the data that was worked on during the project. It includes the input data, such as datasets, files, or documents that were processed and analyzed.

Additional Information:

- In the "Results" folder, you will find both the trained model and visual representations (e.g., pictures) depicting the results obtained from the project.
