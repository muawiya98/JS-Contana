Directory Structure:

1. Codes:
   This folder contains all the code files used for working with the payload files. It includes the scripts and modules required for processing and analyzing the data.

2. Feature_selection_results:
   This folder contains the results obtained from executing code for dynamic feature selection based on reinforcement learning. It includes information about the selected features and their importance in the context of the project.

3. Hidden:
   This folder contains the hidden states resulting from combining the hidden states of the two BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) layers with dynamic word embeddings. These hidden states are intermediate representations learned during the model training process.

4. Results:
   This folder contains the results obtained from training the JSContana model. It includes evaluation metrics, model performance, and any other relevant information regarding the trained model.

5. Results_TabuSearch3:
   This folder contains the results obtained from applying the tabu search algorithm. Tabu search is a metaheuristic algorithm used for optimization problems. The folder includes the optimization results generated by the algorithm.

6. Results_for_Entre_Static_Word_Embedding:
   This folder contains the results obtained from data entry on a JSContana form without using the two BiLSTM layers. The data entry was performed using a static word embedding approach. The folder includes the results and analysis based on this approach.

7. DataSets:
   This folder contains the datasets used for the project. It includes the input data, such as files, documents, or datasets that were processed and analyzed.

Additional Information:

- The "Results" folder also includes visual representations, such as pictures or graphs, that depict the results obtained from the project. It may also contain the trained model files.
